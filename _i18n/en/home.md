I am Shixing (Simon) Wang, a Ph.D in physics. I work with Prof. Shankar Muherji in the physics department at Washington University in St. Louis. Despite my major, the main research topic in our lab is actually cell biology. 

My Ph.D project is a system-level study of sizes and counting numbers of multiple organelles in individual yeast cells. In order to do this, my colleagues and I constructed a strain of "rainbow yeast", in which 6 different organelles were tagged with fluorescent proteins of distinct colors.

The big question that I want to tackle throughout my career is: *which level of complexity marks the definitional difference between living and non-living systems*. If one reviews their middle school biology textbook, they would be surprised to find that, although we can say a lot about what living systems can do, there is not much about what qualifies a system to be a living system, i.e. the definition of living systems is incomplete. The ultimate ambition of a physicist who studies biology is, of course, to make biology rigorously a subset of physics.

Besides biophysics, I am interested in various intellectual topics. I keep following the advances in artificial intelligence, and am trying to apply some of their techniques to the imaging system in our lab. I have also published a few papers in astrophysics. I also attended the quantum computing hackathon and got a small prize from Microsoft.

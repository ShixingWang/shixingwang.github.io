## Uncovering the principles coordinating systems-level organelle biogenesis with cellular growth

> Shixing Wang, Deepthi Kailash, Shankar Mukherji

A complete framework of eukaryotic cellular growth control must include the growth of
its defining hallmarks, spatial compartments known as organelles. Here we map out
the correlation structure of systems-level organelle biogenesis with cellular growth
using “rainbow yeast”, allowing simultaneous visualization of 6 major metabolically
active organelles. Hyperspectral imaging of thousands of single rainbow yeast cells
revealed that systems-level organelle biogenesis is organized into collective organelle
modes activated by changes in nutrient availability. Chemical biological dissection
suggests that the sensed growth rate and size of the cell specifically activate these
distinct organelle modes. Mathematical modeling and synthetic biological control of
cytoplasmic availability suggests that the organelle mode structure allows the cell to
maintain growth homeostasis in constant environments while remaining responsive to
environmental change. This regulatory architecture may underlie how
compartmentalization allows eukaryotes to flexibly tune cell sizes and growth rates to
satisfy otherwise incompatible environmental and developmental constraints.
